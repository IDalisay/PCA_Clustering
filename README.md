# PCA_Clustering
A course project utilizing principal component analysis on images to aid in clustering for analysis of customer types. <br>
Before creating clustering models, techniques such as data exploration, transformation, and cleaning were used to better understand the dataset.<br>
PCA was then performed to reduce dimensionality of data for improving computational efficiency and data interpretability in visualizations.
